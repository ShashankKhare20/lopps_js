// Conditional statements in JavaScript are used to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions. They allow you to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false.

1-If Statement:
The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. 

if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
  }

let temperature = 25;

if (temperature > 30) {
console.log("It's a hot day!");
}
  

2-if-else Statement:

The if-else statement is an extension of the if statement. It allows you to execute one block of code if the condition is true and another block if the condition is false.

if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
  } else {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is false
  }

3-switch statement:

The switch statement is used when you have multiple possible conditions and want to execute different code blocks based on the value of an expression.

switch (expression) {
    case value1:
      // Code to be executed if expression === value1
      break;
    case value2:
      // Code to be executed if expression === value2
      break;
    // ... more cases ...
    default:
      // Code to be executed if none of the cases match
  }
